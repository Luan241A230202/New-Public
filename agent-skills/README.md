# Agent Skills (New-Public Project)

Goal: Provide core knowledge for AI/agents to work quickly and safely with the project.

## Table of contents
- [Backend](./backend.md)
- [Frontend](./frontend.md)
- [Vận hành & Triển khai](./ops.md)

## General rules
- Prefer small changes; avoid breaking existing structure.
- Security required: auth + scope + rate limit for external APIs.
- Record important changes in CHANGELOG and related docs (ADMIN_UI, ENV, frontend-api.txt).
